### About me

I like to tinker with computers/software, learning about good software architecture, and
mathematics. I am captivated by the beauty of functional programming and I am going
down the rabbit hole of learning some category theory for the sake of it.
My current long term goal is to finish developing/deploy my stock trading system.
In the mean time, I am looking for work where I can enhance my functional
programming skills and generate value for the shareholders of the company.

### Technical Skills

A short summery of some of my most relevant technical skills.

#### Programming

| Language | Level        |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Haskell  | Intermediate |
| Python   | Fluent       |
| Fennel   | Fluent       |
| Lua      | Fluent       |
| Shell    | Fluent       |
| Rust     | Basic        |
| VHDL     | Basic        |
| C        | Superficial  |

#### Markup

| Language | Level        |
| -------- | ------------ |
| LaTeX    | Fluent       |
| markdown | Fluent       |
| HTML     | Proficient   |

#### Databases

| Type         | Implementation        |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| NoSQL        | MongoDB               |
| SQL          | Postgres, TimescaleDB |
| Memory Cache | Redis                 |
| Message bus  | Kafka, SQS, Nats      |

#### Software

Here is a table some software that might be worth mentioning that I have
interacted with.

| Name       | Level        |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Git        | Fluent       |
| Kubernetes | Proficient   |
| Helm       | Proficient   |
| Terraform  | Intermediate |
| CircleCI   | Proficient   |
| Tekton     | Proficient   |
| Docker     | Fluent       |
| Neovim     | Fluent       |
| tmux       | Proficient   |
| neomutt    | Proficient   |

I have plans on learning [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io), as this seems to
be a better alternative of k8s. I am also moving to [podman](https://podman.io/)
next time I work with containers in my spare time. I am also keen working more
with service meshes, to improve my knowledge of their capabilities.

#### Operating Systems

I use Artix Linux as my daily OS. However, I would like to transition to OpenBSD
soon. But, I am a bit afraid of the lack of support for Nvidia GPUs.
Unfortunately, I use macOS for work.

#### Workflow

I use neovim for all development, together with dwm as a tiling
window manager, and st as the terminal of choice. I am very happy with this
setup, but would like to improve the workflow with increased tmux usage and
git worktrees, à la [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXxvxSlzJdI).
I use a ferris sweep keyboard with Colemak Mod-DH layout. I moved on from
qwerty as I do not believe that you should go through life using suboptimal
solutions from the past, just because you cannot bother learning something new.

#### Architecture

Good software is like physics, it should avoid too much complexity, like von
Neumann famously stated, *"With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with
five I can make him wiggle his trunk"*. I adhere by the [unix
philosophy](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html), as well
as the [suckless philosophy](https://suckless.org/philosophy/). I truly believe
that you develop better software by following these principles.

For designing and implementing distributed web service systems, I really like
the framework presented in the book *The Tao of Microservices*. Web services
should almost be provocatively small, most communication between services
should be asynchronous. You should at all cost avoid building a distributed
monolith with entangled dependencies.
